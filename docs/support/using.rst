Using Firefly III
=================

If you're unsure about how to use Firefly III just check out these pages to get some more bearings. Personally, I try to open my instance at least once a day. I do not import data (as a :ref:`principe <grandtheory>`) so I have no choice but to visit every so often. But this gives me the chance to view some reports and get an idea of what I am doing.

There are many pages here that can help you figure things out. If everything fails, just :ref:`contact me <contact>`!
