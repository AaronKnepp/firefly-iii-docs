Feature requests and roadmap
============================

First of all, thanks for suggesting a feature to improve Firefly III. I appreciate your input. 

You can send any request `to me by email <mailto:thegrumpydictator@gmail.com>`_ or `open a ticket on GitHub <https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues>`_.

Roadmap and release schedule
----------------------------

There is no formal roadmap for Firefly III. However, I try to release a new version of Firefly III every month. Check out the `milestones on GitHub <https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/milestones>`_ to see what is being considered for future versions.

Often requested features
------------------------

Some features are already `on the roadmap <https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues>`_, so be sure to check it out. Others will probably never make it into Firefly III for various reasons. Here is a (short) list of commonly requested items, that will probably never make it into Firefly III:

* Sub-accounts, sub-categories, sub-budgets, etc., will not be featured in Firefly III. Generally speaking, these do not add *meaningful* information to your transactions.
* The ability to share a financial administration with your partner or significant other. Unfortunately, this requires a large change in Firefly III's architecture and functionality. As an alternative, you could share the login details with each other.
* Firefly III will not support stock accounts, investment tracking, real estate or other features besides basic personal finances. If you're looking for something like that, please check out GNUCash.
