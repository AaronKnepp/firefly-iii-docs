Notable about this return are the following aspects:

* The ``recurrence_repetitions`` array you see can hold more than one recurrence repetition. This is impossible in the Firefly III user interface but certainly possible through the API.
* The same goes for the ``transactions`` array.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

The list is paginated. Use ``page`` to get the next page or use the links from ``links``. 

Get once recurring transactions
-------------------------------

``GET /api/v1/recurrences/<id>``

Returns a single recurring transaction.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``include`` parameter to include related objects. These parameters can be combined (use a comma).

* ``include=user``. Includes the user. This is always you.
* ``include=transactions``. The transactions already created by the recurring transactions.

Create a recurring transaction
------------------------------

``POST /api/v1/recurrences``

Creates a new recurring transaction. 

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

Required global fields

* ``type``. The type of transaction you wish to make. Must be ``withdrawal``, ``deposit`` or ``transfer``.
* ``title``. Title of the recurring transaction.
* ``first_date``. First date that the recurring transaction will fire. Must always be in the future.
* ``apply_rules``. After creating the recurring transaction, fire your rules? ``0`` or ``1``.
* ``active``. Is the recurring transaction active? ``0`` or ``1``.

For each repetition, you need to submit the following. Extra repetitions can be created. Use ``1``, ``2``, etc.

* ``repetitions[0][type]``. Required. The type of repetition. Valid options are: ``daily``, ``weekly``, ``ndom``, ``monthly``, ``yearly``.
* ``repetitions[0][moment]``. Required. Repetition type meta data. See below for explanations.
* ``repetitions[0][skip]``. Required. How many repetitions to skip every time.
* ``repetitions[0][weekend]``. Required. How to respond when it's a weekend. See below for explanation.


For the transaction, you can submit multiple entries (effectively making a split transction). These are the values. Extra transactions can be created. Use ``1``, ``2``, etc.

* ``transactions[0][description]``. Required. Description of the transaction.
* ``transactions[0][amount]``. Required. The amount of the transaction.
* ``transactions[0][currency_id]``. Required if no ``currency_code``. The currency to use for the transaction.
* ``transactions[0][currency_code]``. Required if no ``currency_id``. The currency to use for the transaction.
* ``transactions[0][foreign_amount]``. Optional. Foreign amount for the tranaction.
* ``transactions[0][foreign_currency_id]``. Optional. Required when the foreign amount is submitted. You need to submit either the ID or the code.
* ``transactions[0][foreign_currency_code]``. Optional. Required when the foreign amount is submitted. You need to submit either the ID or the code.

* ``transactions[0][destination_name]``. The name of the destination account for this transaction. Must be of the correct account type. Submit either the ID or the name.


Optional global fields

* ``description``. Not to be confused with the transaction description, this field describes the recurring transaction itself.
* ``repeat_until``. Until when the recurring transaction must run. Is not required. Cannot be combined with ``nr_of_repetitions``.
* ``nr_of_repetitions``. Denotes how many transactions the system can make before stopping. Cannot be combined with ``repeat_until``.
* ``tags``. Comma separated list of tags. Applies to all transactions.
* ``piggy_bank_id``. Link the transcation(s) to a piggy bank. Only works for transfers.

Repetition types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Valid repetition types are ``daily``, ``weekly``, ``ndom``, ``monthly``, ``yearly``.

* ``daily``. The ``moment`` value must be empty.

* ``monthly``. The day of the month, between 1-31.
* ``yearly``. A full date, like ``2018-11-27``. The year does not matter.
