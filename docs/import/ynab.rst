Import from YNAB
================

Firefly III supports the YNAB API. Although support is in beta and may not be perfect, it works surprisingly well.

Support is fairly straight-forward, just follow the instructions. 

GitHub user  `@ment4list <https://github.com/ment4list>`_ has written very good instructions in `this GitHub issue <https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues/2272>`_ which you should definitely check out.
