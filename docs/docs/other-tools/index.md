# Other tools

There are a number of Firefly III tools and libraries you can check out and use, which are made by me.

Community contributions can be found on the **[third-party tools](../firefly-iii/other-pages/3rdparty)** page.

## Product manager

The [Firefly III product manager](https://github.com/JC5/product-manager) is a tool that you can use to manage costs over time, for example for your car or for your appliances.

## Auto-save tool

The [Firefly III auto-save tool](https://github.com/JC5/autosave) is a tool that you can use to automatically create new "top up"-transactions that round your expenses up to the nearest Euro.

## Libraries

### API support classes

A [small package](https://github.com/JC5/api-support-classes) with code to use the Firefly III API. Is used in the data import tools.

### Recovery code thing

A small change to [a recovery code package](https://github.com/JC5/recovery) so it's compatible with PHP %PHPVERSION.

### 2FA laravel code things

Some changes to [a 2FA package](https://github.com/JC5/google2fa-laravel) so it can handle 2FA authentication over sessions.

### API docs

The [Firefly III API docs](https://github.com/firefly-iii/api-docs) and [the underlying generator](https://github.com/firefly-iii/api-docs-generator).
