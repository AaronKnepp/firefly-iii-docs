# General questions

## Is the data importer multi-user?

Yes. It borrows login information from Firefly III using OAuth. To make sure it redirects to Firefly III, where you can log in, **do not** set the `FIREFLY_III_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the data importer environment variables. Use only the `FIREFLY_III_URL` variable. This way, each user must authenticate to the data importer.

Some features are not available when you set up a multi-user data importer: you cannot use the POST import function, and you can't import over the command line.
