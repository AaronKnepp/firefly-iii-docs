# Where to start?

For a lot of people, the first time importing data is a bit of a hack and an experiment. To prevent stress and frustration, please follow these tips and tricks.

## Create all asset accounts first

Validate you have asset accounts for each of your accounts. That includes savings accounts and credit cards

## Do not import large batches

Start with ten transactions. Or maybe five. Don't try to import 4 years worth at once.

## Map and rule

Use the mapping function and Firefly III's [rules](../../firefly-iii/features/rules.md) to manage data quality. You can read more about this on the page about **[data clean-up](../how-to-use/clean-up-data.md)**.
