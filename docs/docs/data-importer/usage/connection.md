# Country/bank selection + connection

Depending on Spectre or Nordigen, you may be faced with some options when you follow the necessary steps.

## Spectre

Spectre supports multiple "connections", so either you select an existing one or create a new one. A "connection" is literally what it says, a connection to your financial institution where transactions will be downloaded from.  

## Nordigen

Nordigen will ask you for your country and your bank in that country.
