# Clean up data

You have several options to clean up the data that comes from your bank.

## Clean up using mapping

Use the [mapping feature](map.md) to clean up the data. This is the easiest option to catch weird data early.

## Clean up using rules

Use [Firefly III rules](../../firefly-iii/features/rules.md) to look for incoming transactions and change them as necessary.

## Clean up using webhooks

Use [Firefly III webooks](../../firefly-iii/features/webhooks.md) to manage transaction content using webhooks. A webhook allows you to introduce custom scripting to Firefly III. It is the most powerful, but also the most complicated way to manage your transactions.
