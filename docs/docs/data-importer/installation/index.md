# Installation

The Firefly III Data Importer (or **FIDI**) is a tool separate from [Firefly III](../../firefly-iii/). You can read more about that on [another page](../more-information/separate-tool.md).

If you had previously installed FIDI, following the **[upgrade instructions](upgrade.md)** is enough.

For the installation of FIDI, you have several choices.

## Installation choices

In no specific order of preference:

- Install and run using **[Docker](docker.md)**
- Install and run a **[self-hosted instance](self-hosted.md)**
- Don't install anything, but use the **[public instance](public.md)**

## Configuration

In all cases FIDI needs **[post-installation configuration](configure.md)**.
