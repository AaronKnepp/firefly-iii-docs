## Is it possible to import from multiple banks?

Yes, this is possible. In both cases, you'll have to run the data importer a few times (once for each bank) and save the configuration file. Make sure you rename it to something useful like "your-bank.json". Use the file during your next run of the data importer.

If the data importer caches something, please make sure to press "Start Over" before you import from the next bank.
