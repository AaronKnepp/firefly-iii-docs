# Firefly III personal finance questions

## What should I do when I close a real life asset account?

To close an account in Firefly III, do the following.

1. The balance must be zero by transferring out or withdrawing the final balance.
2. Edit the account (look for the pencil icon or use the ellipsis-menu) and remove the checkbox next to **Active**.

You can find the inactive asset account on a special page: `/inactive-accounts/asset`.

See [the tutorial on how process a refund](../../../tutorials/finances/refund.md).

## How do I set the balance of an account?

You **don't**. You can only influence the balance of an account by actually making or importing transactions that influence the balance. You can't just change the balance of the account.

### But then what's the opening balance for?

The opening balance is meant to set the balance of an account at the **start** of your Firefly III administration. That means that NO earlier transactions exist in your administration, and the opening balance reflects that. It summarizes all the transactions that happened before you started using Firefly III.
