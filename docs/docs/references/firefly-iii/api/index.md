Firefly III features a JSON API.

Please visit the [dedicated Swagger documentation](https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org/) where you can read and try the API. [A PHP library](https://github.com/StanSoftBG/oauth2-firefly-iii) was developed by [StanSoft.BG Ltd.](https://github.com/StanSoftBG) that you can use to talk to Firefly III in PHP.

The API is slated to become the only way to talk to Firefly III: even the UI would use the API exclusively. Alas, this is a work in progress.
