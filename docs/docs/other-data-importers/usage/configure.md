# Configure the import

This page contains instructions on how to configure your YNAB import.

When you start an import you'll be presented with a list of options. Some may be set already because you've used a configuration file.

## Accounts

Select the accounts you want to import from. For some accounts, the importer will force a mapping. Others, you can pick yourself.

## Date range

Select the date range to import. Duplicate transactions (transactions that have been imported earlier) will not be imported.

## Rules

Select this if you want Firefly III to apply your rules to the import. This may slow down the import.

## Map data

Allows you to [map data](map.md) after the transactions have been downloaded.

## Other options

If you want to, check the "skip form" button so you don't have to go through these options each time you start an import.
