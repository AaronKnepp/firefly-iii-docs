## I came over from YNAB, I don't get it?

YNAB and Firefly III have a slightly different way of working.

YNAB kind of works the other way around, by budgeting the money that comes in instead of the money that goes out. They expect you to think of a budget for every coin tossed to you instead of budgeting what you expect to spend.

YNAB expects you to put your money into budgets based on whatever money comes in. But that's not how Firefly III works.

Firefly III works the other way around. At the start of the month, you decide what you want to spend. 1000? 1500? Whatever you want! That money is divided over budgets and spent over a monthly period (or whatever period you want).

If everything is OK, your budget should at least match what you earn. So that's easy. But if everything is _better_ than OK, you budget **less** than you make, and you **save** the rest. You can use the rest of the money to fill piggy banks or donate to me (kidding ;)).
