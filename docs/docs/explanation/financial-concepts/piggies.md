If you want to buy something expensive, you might need to save for it. You can use piggy banks to save money. You can find them under "Financial Control" > "Piggy banks". A piggy bank is meant to group money on a single asset account together.

The idea is that you create a piggy bank for the money on your savings account. The money in your savings account can be added and removed to piggy banks freely. You can also transfer money in and out of your savings account and select a piggy bank to be associated with the transfer. The money will be added to (or removed from) the piggy bank as part of the transfer.

You can't create a withdrawal or a deposit and refer to a piggy bank. It only works for transfers.

Basically, a piggy bank is a way to divide a savings account in X parts, and divide the money among these parts.
