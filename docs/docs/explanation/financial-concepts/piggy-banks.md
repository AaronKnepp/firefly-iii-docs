## What is a piggy bank in Firefly III?

If you want to buy something expensive, you might need to save for it. You can use "piggy banks" to organize your savings. A piggy bank is a way to divide your money in a number of parts. A piggy bank is meant to group money on a single asset account together.

## Where are piggy banks stored?

Piggy banks are stored under the `/piggy-banks`-page in Firefly III. Each piggy bank is tied to an asset account on which its money is saved. You may have a savings account with three piggy banks, for example.

## And then what?

The money in your savings account can be added and removed to piggy banks freely. You can also transfer money in and out of your savings account and select a piggy bank to be associated with the transfer. The money will be added to (or removed from) the piggy bank as part of the transfer.

You can't create a withdrawal or a deposit and refer to a piggy bank. It only works for transfers.
