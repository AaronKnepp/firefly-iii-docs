You can keep an eye on your expected recurring expenses by creating bills. Things like rent and utilities must be paid every month and Firefly III can keep track of such things.

The idea of a bill is that it represents a recurring *subscription* that comes back every week, month or year. Bills don't automatically update your budgets, they aren't linked to those. You have to do that yourself. 

Essentially a bill is just a collection of withdrawals. You can't link income or transfers to bills, only withdrawals. So, you can't use bills to keep track of your salary or your savings account.

Bills also have some properties like a basic repetition (every week, every 3 months) and a minimum and maximum amount. These properties are used to predict how much you should expect to spend on these bills. On the frontpage, a little box will tell you how you're doing. It's possible to connect a bill to a withdrawal more often than your repetition would predict. It's also possible to link transactions with more or less money than your minimum and maximum amounts.
