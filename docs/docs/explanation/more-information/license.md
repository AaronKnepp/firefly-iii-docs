## Questions

I often get asked the same questions, so here are the answers.

### Can I run a commercial (hosted) version of Firefly III?

That is OK. Any changes you make to Firefly III need to be made open source under the AGPLv3. That means hosting a repository somewhere with the source code of your hosted version.

### Can I pay you to do the development of custom feature X for me?

Yes. However, the code will be released under the AGPLv3 as well. And if I like the feature I will definitely port it back to Firefly III. Having said that, I currently do not have the time to do more development than I already do, paid or not. So if you ask me, the answer is probably "no".

### Can I pay somebody else to do custom development on Firefly III?

Yes. Anybody can fork and change Firefly III. If you want a specific feature, but you're not a developer, you can pay somebody to build it for you. But the code must also be released publicly under the AGPLv3. That means hosting a repository somewhere with the source code of "Firefly III + my cool changes".

That is OK. Any changes you make to Firefly III need to be made open source under the AGPLv3. That means hosting a repository somewhere with the source code of "My Awesome Finance App".
