# (Security) testing

You are always welcome to see if you can find security problems in Firefly III. Many have been found before, and I'm sure many are still left in the code somewhere.

If you find anything, please refer to [the support page](../support.md) and [the security policy](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/security/policy).

## Testing on the demo site

!!! warning "Using cURL and other tools"
    The server running the demo site detects and blocks most automated tools.

Please do not try to break things on [the demo site](../firefly-iii/about/demo.md). Set up your own instance, and break that one instead. The demo site is for demoing, not for testing.

If I find you trying to break the demo site, I will ban your IP address.

If you have in fact been banned already and have been redirected to this page, please contact me if you feel this was in error. The [support page](../support.md) has my contact details. 

Thank you for allowing other users to try and test Firefly III without interference.
