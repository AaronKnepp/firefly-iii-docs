# Using Kubernetes

In the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/firefly-iii/kubernetes) you will find a bunch of YAML files that denote a pretty standard service offering for Firefly III, the Data Importer and an accompanying MySQL database.

You can find more [instructions on GitHub](https://firefly-iii.github.io/kubernetes/) on how to upgrade.

!!! note
    These instructions aren't very long, and I'm sorry about that. Most stuff is documented on the GitHub page and I just don't know very much about Kubernetes myself. If you feel you can expand this page, please press the edit button next to the title
