# Search

You can search for transactions using the box in the left top of the page. Apart from basic stuff like `Groceries` or `"query with spaces"`, you can also use special operators to search.

Check out the [full reference to the search options](../../../references/firefly-iii/search.md).

You can combine operators like so: `some:operator another:thing` but you can't use `AND` or `OR`.
