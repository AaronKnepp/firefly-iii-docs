# How-to guides

These how-to guides will show you how to do things. The guides are goal oriented and will get you to a specific point.

Popular examples:

1. How to [install Firefly III](firefly-iii/installation/docker.md)?
2. How to set up [email notifications](firefly-iii/advanced/notifications.md)?
3. How to [configure GoCardless](data-importer/how-to-configure.md)?

The menu on the left should guide your through the guides (hah). 

## Missing something?

1. You're missing a specific how-to guide, and you wish to write it
2. You don't want to write it, but you still miss a specific how-to guide
3. You spot inaccuracies, terrible grammar or spelling mistakes
