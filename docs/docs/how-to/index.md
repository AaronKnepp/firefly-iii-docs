# How-to guides

These how-to guides will show you how to do things. The guides are goal oriented and will get you to a specific point.

Popular examples:

1. How to install Firefly III?
2. How to set up email notifications?
3. How to configure GoCardless?

The menu on the left should guide your through the guides (hah). 

## Missing something?

1. You're missing a specific how-to guide, and you wish to write it
2. You don't want to write it, but you still miss a specific how-to guide
3. You spot inaccuracies, terrible grammar or spelling mistakes
