# How to report security issues

The latest instructions are in [the security policy](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/security). Please follow those instructions closely.

Each installation comes with a security.txt file in the `.well-known/security.txt`. The [demo site as well](https://demo.firefly-iii.org/.well-known/security.txt).

## Bounty program

Firefly III has no bounty program. I have no money to pay you if you find anything.
