# Installing and upgrading

## I get an error during the automatic installation and upgrade?

* `proc_close`: The `proc_close` method (part of PHP) is disabled in some cases due to security concerns.
* Open base dir restriction is sometimes enabled for security purposes.
* Other error messages.

These errors are not fatal for Firefly III, but they mean you must do the upgrade yourself.

Please check out the installation instructions and upgrade instructions for your particular type of installation.
