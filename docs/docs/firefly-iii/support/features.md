# Feature requests and roadmap

First of all, thanks for suggesting a feature to improve Firefly III. I appreciate your input.

You can send any request [to me by email](mailto:james@firefly-iii.org) or [open a ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues).

## Roadmap and release schedule

There is no formal roadmap for Firefly III. However, I try to release a new version of Firefly III every month.

## Ideas that won't be implemented

Some ideas are suggested regularly. Unfortunately, I can't or won't implement all of them.

- Stock and portfolio management
- Business finances, small business accounting, payroll management
- The ability to predict or report on *future* transactions.
- Automated currency conversion so everything is in your favorite currency.
- The ability to set sub-categories, sub-budgets, sub-accounts, etc.
- More complicated rules, like AND or OR and other boolean logic.
- The ability to change the monthly cycle to another day of the month.

## If you're not going to implement my idea, could you at least make it optional?

Sometimes I can't or won't implement a certain feature, or change how something works. Let me reassure you this isn't personal or something. We could just disagree on things and that's fine. But instead of offering options for everything I want Firefly III to have [sensible defaults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration).
