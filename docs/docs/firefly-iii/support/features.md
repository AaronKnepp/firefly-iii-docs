# Feature requests and roadmap

First of all, thanks for suggesting a feature to improve Firefly III. I appreciate your input.

You can send any request [to me by email](mailto:james@firefly-iii.org) or [open a ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues).

## Roadmap and release schedule

There is no formal roadmap for Firefly III. However, I try to release a new version of Firefly III every month.
