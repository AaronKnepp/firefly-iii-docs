# Architecture

On this page you'll find the architecture of Firefly III. It's not meant as an explanation of where everything is but rather as a means to show you how everything is structured. If you ever want to develop something here's what you need to know.

    This page is under construction. Feedback is welcome, but don't tell me stuff is missing, I know.

## Database

![Basic database structure](images/database.png)

In the image previous, you can see a graphical overview of the most important parts of the database.

### Transactions

Denoted in shades of red. A transaction group ties multiple transaction journals together. Each journal contains two transactions. A transaction either removes or adds money from an account.

Accounts and transaction journals share the same currency. Transaction journals may also have a "foreign" currency, which is another reference to a currency.

Rule groups contain rules. Rules have actions and triggers. Although actions and triggers may reference to budgets, categories and tags and other things, there is no database relationship.

Transaction journals have meta data like categories and bills.

Accounts are linked to transactions and to piggy banks. A transfer (see transaction type) may link a transaction journal to a piggy bank in a piggy bank event. Together they form the history of the piggy bank. A piggy bank event may exist without a link to a transaction journal.

## Code

Firefly III is based on Laravel, and uses the MVC model.

### Models

Models are stored in app/Models. Everything in Firefly III has an associated model.

### Views

All views are stored in resources/views/. 

### Controllers

Most pages are generated by controllers in app/Http/Controllers.
