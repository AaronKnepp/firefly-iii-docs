# Firefly III logo and name

The name of the tool is "Firefly III". It was named after the [Fairey Firefly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairey_Firefly) because at the time all my project names were British airplanes from the WW2 era. It's called "Firefly III" because this is the third major iteration of the original "Firefly I".

The Firefly III logo was designed by the excellent Cherie Woo on my request.

This page explains how you use the logo and Firefly III name in a way that fits Firefly III. In most cases, you’ll need to get my permission first. The logo is copyrighted, obviously.

## General usage

Here's the thing: I don't mind people using the logo for their own tools and things. I wrote Firefly III as open source software under a copyleft license for a good reason. Spread the word!

I have however, on occassion, noticed subpar tools and things that are suddenly "my responsibility" because they carry the logo or call themselves Firefly III. That's not going to fly. I would like to be responsible for my own subpar tools, thank you very much. 

### Talk about, not as, Firefly III

Use the logo to refer to Firefly III and the associated tools. Don’t use the logo in a way that suggests partnership or endorsement by Firefly III. If you decide to use the "Firefly III" name, use something like "Cool tool for Firefly III". Using the logo is generally fine in this context (ask me!).

## The logo

(img)

The Firefly III is a canvassed piggy, surrounded by a flame. The tail is inverted "into" the piggy. The main color of the logo is #something. You may recognize the butt of the piggy in the favicon of Firefly III.

Always download the official logo from this page. Don’t modify the graphics or use modified versions you might find on the internet.
