# Financial management

!!! warning
    This piece of the documentation feels a bit like a rant, so let me preface this by an apology for my tone of voice.

It's important for (new) Firefly III users to realise the following three concepts when dealing with financial management tools. These points apply to Firefly III but also to other financial tools.

1. There are no solutions that will suddenly bring clarity to your personal finances.
2. A tool won't be able to tell you why you're broke.
3. Importing 10 years of transactions doesn't give you 10 years of (previously) lost insight.

What you need in order to get these answers is the following. And again, it could be with Firefly III but also with any other tool.

1. The only way to get clarity is by [grinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grinding_(video_games). Put in the work to really understand your own transactions and spending habits.
2. Having done that, you'll learn what you knew already deep down: why you're broke.
3. Looking back at 10 years ago won't help.

The reason I mention this is because many users have the wrong expectations. They believe that if they just pump enough data into Firefly III, the dashboard will explain them how to become a millionaire. 

I wish it was that easy, everybody!

by looking at Firefly III's fancy charts, or by adding tags to their expenses, it'll suddenly become clear why 


Deep down, you probably know this yourself already.

People tend to download Firefly III in the full expectation they can just import five year's worth of transactions and Firefly III will make everything super clear. Unfortunately that's just not how it works.

First, most banks are terrible when it comes to transaction management so your import will be terrible and you will learn nothing. All you will learn is that takes a huge amount of time to fix your own terrible import.



Only after importing 10 years worth of transactions, you'll realize that i



There is no such tool. Firefly III is no such tool.

 



Second, the time and effort it takes to make *any* financial tool analyse your financial situation is the time and effort it would take *you* to analyse your financial situation. A tool like Firefly III can only tell you what you knew deep down already.



## Financial management isn't sexy

It comes down to this: you enter all of your transactions, *by hand*, and you'll learn something you knew already: you suck at money management. You buy too much expensive bullshit. You make too little to support your life. The rent is too damn high. And you knew this already.
