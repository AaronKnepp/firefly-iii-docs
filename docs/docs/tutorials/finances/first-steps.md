# Create accounts and transactions

!!! tip
    I've not yet finished writing this tutorial. Some items may not be filled in yet. I apologize for the inconvenience. Please refer to the [support page](../../references/support.md) if you have questions.

Let's assume you managed to install Firefly III using the [how-to guides](../../how-to/index.md). You've got a working installation, and you're ready to go. What's next?

In this tutorial you will learn how to set up your first accounts so they match your bank statements. You will also learn how to create some transactions.

This tutorial assumes you already registered yourself, as it is explained in the [how-to guides](../../how-to/index.md).

## First setup 

You will see this screen when you run Firefly III for the first time:

Choose your currency and language.

Fill in the name of your bank. If you know your bank account's balance, don't fill it in. Instead, fill in *yesterday's* balance. This will make sure you can create transactions from today.  Firefly III will calculate today's balance for you, and this is a nice way to check if everything works as expected.

Similarly, fill in yesterday's savings account balance, if you happen to have a savings account.

## Check for correctness

Once you have filled in these details, the home page of Firefly III greets you.

In the left menu, click Accounts > Asset accounts. Here you should see your bank accounts and some extra's, with yesterday's balance.

## Create a transaction

Let's create our first transaction. Use your bank statements to find out which transactions we can create. Since we entered yesterday's balance in the account form,
it's best to recreate yesterday's transactions by hand. We can look into importing data later. 

Click the PLUS button in the top right corner next to your email address. Then click "New withdrawal". You will see this screen:

There are a lot of options to fill in, but we're going to stick to the basics for now.

1. Under "Description", fill what the transaction was for. Example: "Groceries", "this month's rent" or "present for my mom".
2. Under "Source account", use the keyboard to type your bank account name and select your main bank account from the list.
3. Under "Destination account", type the name of the store where the transaction took place. For example: "Walmart", "Amazon" or "MacDonalds".

Under date, you select yesterday's date using the dropdown. You can also enter the time if you wish.

Under amount, you enter the amount. The amount must always be positive, even though this is a withdrawal.

We won't use the other fields for now. Scroll down if necessary and press "Submit".
