# Introduction

In order to import transactions into Firefly III, you'll have to install the **[Firefly III Data Importer](../../data-importer/index.md)**. This app connects to the [Firefly III API](https://api-docs.firefly-iii.org/).

Firefly III and the Data Importer are two different applications.

This data importer is a universal importer, which means it can import from any sources you can think of. And if it can't, well then drop me a line and make me add your favorite data source.

The data import supports a variety of sources:

- You can import **CSV files** from *any* source: your bank, YNAB, Tiller or any other source of financial data.
- You can import from your bank directly using a secure connection.
- You can set it up to run daily or weekly to keep Firefly III up to date.

## Other import tools

The documentation for the Data Importer lists [other tools](../../data-importer/more-information/other-tools.md) that you can use to import data.

## Custom importing

If none of these import methods support your bank or financial organisation, please check out the [API](../api/index.md).
