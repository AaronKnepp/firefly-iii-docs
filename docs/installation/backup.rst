Backup
======

If you want to make a backup of all your data, make sure you grab the following:

- The ``.env`` file in the root of your installation.
- The entire database or database file (in ``/storage/database``)
- All uploads from ``/storage/uploads``
- Any exports from ``/storage/export``

That way you have everything you need in case of problems.
