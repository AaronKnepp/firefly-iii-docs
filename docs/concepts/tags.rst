Tags
====

Tags are an extension of :ref:`categories <categories>` and meant to expand on the meta-data included in a `transaction <transactions>`. You can add multiple tags to a transaction.

Tags can be useful to group expenses together, possibly in another context than your categories. For examples, tags might include:

* ``too-expensive``
* ``work-expense``

Or maybe something else entirely. This is up to you.

Special tags
------------

When you import data into Firefly III, a special tag will be created for each transaction. It is called `Import with key 'xxxx'` where the key is a custom code every time.
