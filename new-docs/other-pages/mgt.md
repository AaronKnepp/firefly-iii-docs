# Financial management

{% hint style="warning" %}
This piece of the documentation feels a bit like a rant, so let me preface this by an apology for my tone of voice.
{% endhint %}

I think it's important for (new) Firefly III users to realise the following.

* There is *no magic solution* that will bring clarity to your personal finances.
* There is *no tool* that will magically make it clear why you're broke.
* There is absolutely *no tool* that will take your 10-year financial history and make it clear or concise or ready for analysis.

There is no such tool. Firefly III is no such tool.

People tend to download Firefly III in the full expectation they can just import five year's worth of transactions and Firefly III will make everything super clear. No. Not going to happen.

First, most banks are terrible when it comes to transaction management so your import will be terrible and you will learn nothing. All you will learn is that takes a huge amount of time to fix your own terrible import.

Second, the time and effort it takes to make *any* financial tool analyse your financial situation is the time and effort it would take *you* to analyse your financial situation. A tool like Firefly III can only tell you what you knew deep down already.



## Financial management isn't sexy

It comes down to this: you enter all of your transactions, *by hand*, and you'll learn something you knew already: you suck at money management. You buy too much expensive bullshit. You make too little to support your life. The rent is too damn high. And you knew this already.
