# Import from YNAB

Firefly III supports the YNAB 5 API. Although support is in beta and may not be perfect, it works surprisingly well.

Support is fairly straight-forward, just follow the instructions. 

GitHub user  [@ment4list](https://github.com/ment4list) has written very good instructions in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues/2272) which you should definitely check out.
